Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This repository is my personal project and a collaborative space for anyone interested in contributing to the development of a centralized, secure, and transparent municipal barangay management system. The goal is to empower local officials with efficient governance tools while providing citizens with open access to non-sensitive, aggregated data on barangay performance, programs, and development metrics.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and help build a better future for our communities!
